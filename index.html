                       <p>As the country and society go through ups and downs, so does Nimta High School. Unknown to many, Nimta, as a township, is older than Kolkata (Calcutta). It has a traditional past. When the political landscape changed in Gaur Bengal, its influence on religion and culture generally declined, as in other regions. Many believe that there was a Buddhist monastery here during the pre-Sultan period. In the 16th century, Nityananda Mahaprabhu came to preach Vaishnavism, and the Navadwipa-sanctioned toll was established here. The education of Ram Ram Bose, the famous munshi of Keri Sahib, is in Nimtar Tole. Poet Krishna Ramdas, author of Raimangal Kalikamangal Kavya, and Satyendranath Dutta, the magical poet of Rabindra Snehadhanya Samaj Conscious Manav Dardi Chand, were born here. The position of Savarna Roy Chowdhury was once in this niche. Nimta had a place as a growing village, so the cultural milieu was shaped accordingly. Nimta High English School was established because of the Wood Despatch during the English Company period and the demand for English education. Calcutta University records show that in 1881 AD, three candidates from Nimta High School were candidates for the then entrance examination, and two passed. (It may be recalled that the place where the school is established today was donated by local philanthropists, and the school was established as a collective effort - a private initiative). The school then declined due to rapid population decline. Plague and malaria epidemics further affected the area, resulting in an increase in the number of burnt houses. Education was interrupted due to health issues. Nimta High English School became a sixth-form school. These events took place before the partition and independence of the country. The situation arising from the partition and independence brought about a great change in the organization of the people in this region. As a result, under the pressure of the natural expansion of education, the degraded 'Nimta School' students were upgraded to eighth-grade schools in the early second half of the last century (from a minor school to a junior high). The 9th class was approved in 1954, and the 10th class in 1955, by the concerned authorities. In 1956, the students of the newly formed Nimta High School took the school's final examination, and all candidates passed. This journey marked the beginning of a great advancement of education in the region. The school's academic standards were reflected in its test results, and it soon became one of the "best" schools in the region. It was then upgraded to an 11th standard school in 1954, and to the present 12th standard school in 1976. Nimta High School, a symbol of the socio-economic and cultural prosperity of the region, now stands where the old one-story brick building once was. Currently, our school is recognized by the State Government as a Sponsored School, and the State Government has constituted the SMC (School Management Committee). </p>
